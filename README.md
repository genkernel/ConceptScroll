ConceptScroll
=============

Vertical paging scroller with looping support.

This is example project that uses PagerView component.
PagerView mimics UIScrollView component with paging mode enabled.
Plus it implements additional 'looping' feature: scrolls to the very first page view after the last one.

PagerView has .delegate and .dataSource properties implemented with UITableView in mind.
